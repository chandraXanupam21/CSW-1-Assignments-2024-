Would you like to know more about it?

Ereaders are ideal for bibliophiles who prefer a print-like reading experience but want the option to take their 
entire library with them wherever they go. There are lots of manufacturers and reading platforms to consider, so 
it can be confusing to figure out which is right for you. PCMag has been reviewing ereaders for nearly two decades
 since the very first Kindle, so you can trust that our top picks are based on sound analysis. The Editors' 
 Choice-winning Amazon Kindle Paperwhite and the nearly identical Paperwhite Kids currently top our list since 
 they provide access to a vast digital library and work reliably. Of course, one of the other models here might 
 suit your needs better, so it's worth clicking through to our full reviews. Below the list, we also provide some 
 buying advice to help you during your search.
